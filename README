evernote-connector is a python package which aims to ease communication with Evernote's API.

Assuming you have downloaded Evernote's API files (http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/), you need to place the files from lib/python somewhere on your python path.

Currently, this connector is being developed as part of the mindlocker project (http://mindlocker.net), and it will primarly serve it's purposes.
